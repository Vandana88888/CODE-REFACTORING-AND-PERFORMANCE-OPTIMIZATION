**DESCRIPTION OF TASK(In this task, I created a simple and interactive Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to enter the name of a city and instantly view weather information such as temperature, weather condition, and wind speed. To simulate real-world behavior, the weather data was generated randomly in the absence of a live API. The app includes a responsive and visually appealing design with icons and styled components to enhance user experience. This task helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional rendering in JavaScript while building a real-life application interface.)
